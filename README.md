# MonnBot

Monnbot (Catch me on Discord as Monnicore) is a command-line interface for trading on Binance and FTX. It was designed to make it easy to manage my trades and monitor spreads from the command line. However, due to the falling out of FTX, this CLI is no longer functional.

I have decided to open source this project so that others can learn from it and build their own trading systems using [OCLIF](https://oclif.io/). One of the biggest lessons I learned was the importance of Casino Model, and how having multiple orders over a longer period of time can help you execute your preferred spread range.

## Commands

Monnbot comes with a range of commands that make it easy to manage your trades and monitor the markets. Here are some of the available commands:

- `buypf`: Buys the spread of PERP/FUT pairs.
- `buypu`: Buys the spread of PERP/USD pairs.
- `buyuf`: Buys the spread of USD/FUT pairs.
- `calculate`: Tool for building your ideal position
- `pepe`: Everybody loves the frog
- `positions`: Fetch open positions & account data
- `range`: Get the range between 2 pairs. Ideal for running over long periods of time to get the best available entry.
- `sellpf`: Sells the spread of PERP/FUT pairs
- `sellpu`: Sells the spread of PERP/USD pairs.
- `selluf`: Sells the spread of USD/FUT pairs.
- `spread`: Spread Scalper when there's a lot of volatility.
